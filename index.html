  <p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
  internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
  Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...

  <ul>
    <li>HTML is cool</li>
    <li>CSS is cooler</li>
    <li>JS is the best</li>

  <h1>What do you need to create a website?</h1>

  <p>Not much!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
      <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
      <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
      <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
